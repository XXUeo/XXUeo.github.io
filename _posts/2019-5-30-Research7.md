* ### The book of why

when we seek to emulate human thought on a computer, or indeed when we try to solve unfamiliar scientific problems, drawing an explicit dots-and-arrows picture is extremely useful. 


- THE THREE LEVELS OF CAUSATION 

A causal learner must master at least three distinct levels of cognitive ability: seeing, doing, and imagining. 


The Ladder of Causation, with representative organisms at each level. Most animals, as well as present-day learning machines, are on the first rung, learning from association. Tool users, such as early humans, are on the second rung if they act by planning and not merely by imitation. We can also use experiments to learn the effects of interventions, and presumably this is how babies acquire much of their causal knowledge. Counterfactual learners, on the top rung, can imagine worlds that do not exist and infer reasons for observed phenomena. ( Source: Drawing by Maayan Harel.)
