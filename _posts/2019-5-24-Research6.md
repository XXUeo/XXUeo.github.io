* ### How To Create A Mind


Sequential and in order. it's like hash function. 


maybe the visual info is stored as information, but we can access only through hirerarchical order.

our memory is stord as sequences of patterns.

We can recognize a pattern even if only part of it is received. 



- Hirerarchical Neuron and its pattern

Each pattern is itself in a particular order and is not readily reversed. Even if a pattern appears to have
multideimensional aspects, it is represented by a one-deimensional sequence of lower-level patterns.
A pattern is an ordered sequence of other patterns, so each recognizer is inherently recursive.
There can be many levels of hierarchy.

- Thalamus



Thalamus relies on the structured knowledge contained in the neocortex.
Gateway to enter neocortex. It communicated eith neocortex. Neocortical pattern recognizers talking to thalamus about important stuff.

- Spindle Cell



Spindle cells have long neural flagments called apical dendrites. Connected to many other parts of brain, high-level emotions relate to diverse range of topics and thoughts.
