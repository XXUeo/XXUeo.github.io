### Wittgenstein


[https://www.cmwonderland.com/2018/06/15/Artificial%20Intelligence%20and%20Wittgenstein%27s%20use%20theory%20of%20meaning/ ]


This position of Wittgenstein’s inspiration for today’s AI is: If an AI engineer wants to faithfully reproduce intelligent activities on the symbolic representation level, his working sample can neither be too close to the surface form of human natural language, nor too far away.






The recommended working procedure should be: The researcher must first observe the different functional roles played by the similar “user interface” in different use environments (ie, the input-output relationship), and then re-introduce the most likely programs. Then find the most appropriate engineering simulation method in the existing “arsenal library” of computer science.

purify the word "AI", applying another label for better usage of machine, such as a machine that helps people or a machine that help understand people's thought .
