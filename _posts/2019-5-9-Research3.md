* ### MONet: Unsupervised Scene Decomposition and Representation

[Reading paper 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.11390.pdf) 



Atempt on the model that is capable of learning to decompose and represent challenging 3D scenes into semantically meaningful components, such as objects and background elements


Like today's state of the art of principals on computer vision which goes by having massive amount of labeled data in supervised manner limits the accesibility for most of the people as the materials to be trained on.
